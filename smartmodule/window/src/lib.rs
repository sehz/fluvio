    loc: String, // Location source, either GPS, ODO, MAN, DR or N/A. GPS - location is received from GPS  ODO - location is calculated based on odometer value   MAN - location is specified manually   DR - location is calculated using dead reckoning (used in tunnels and other locations without GPS signal) N/A - location is unavailable
    stop: String, // ID of the stop related to the event (e.g. ID of the stop where the vehicle departed from in case of dep event or the stop where the vehicle currently is in case of vp event).null if the event is not related to any stop.
    route: String, // ID of the route the vehicle is currently running on. Matches route_id in the topic.

Currently passenger occupancy level is only available for Suomenlinna ferries as a proof-of-concept. The value will be available shortly after departure when the ferry operator has registered passenger count for the journey.For other vehicles, currently only values used are 0 (= vehicle has space and is accepting passengers) and 100 (= vehicle is full and might not accept passengers)
